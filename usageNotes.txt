Intializing

Step 1: Download XML dump of Mediawiki
Step 2: Run XMLtoCSV.py file #This might need some help
Step 3: Import CSV into PSQL DB
Step 4: Run monthlyReport.py # Again, ran an earlier version of this; may need updating



Creating clusters

Update yaml.config file
Run statsForClustering.sql, once with the >5 condition (saved to FileA), and once with everyone (saved to FileB)
Run statsToRatios.py on each file, to convert the edit counts to stats # Very sensitive to number of columns
Using the filtered file (FileA), run findBestK.R in R to find best k for kmeans and GMM. Also run pam manually to find k-mediods
Update makeClusters.R with the best k values, then run it to create the clusters


Cluster Stats

Run addClustersToStats.py to add all of the cluster results to the full stats file (modified in place). This also adds cluster "0" for every measure where they weren't active.
Run groupClusterByUser.py to create a file that is users with the cluster they are in for sequential periods
Run clusterChangeStats.py and generateClusterViz.R using the created file
If desired, create a reversed version of the stats by running reverseClusterCSV, and then rerunning generateClusterViz.
The generateClusterViz.R program will create a "modeVals.Rda" file in the working directory, which is then used for network stats, so make sure that you run it with the groupClusterByUser settings the way you want them for the network stats.

Network Stats

Run createNodeList.sql to create a list of nodes of interest
Run filterAttributesFile.py to filter this stats file to the nodes of interest (takes statsFile, nodesList, and outputFile as parameters)
Run makeDBNetworks.py to create networks for the given nodes.
Run getNetworkStats.R, which creates the overall networks, and some network statistics for the modal values of each user.


RSiena

Modify the runAnalysis.R file to run the RSiena simulations needed. May heaven have mercy on your soul.
